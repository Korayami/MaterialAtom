1. Clone the Repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and use the git clone command to download the Atom source code from its official GitHub repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/Korayami/MaterialAtom
```
2. Install Development Dependencies: Navigate into the cloned directory and install any necessary development tools. For Linux, you may need to install libsecret-1-dev. 

```
cd atom
# For Linux, install libsecret-1-dev if it's not already present
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev # For Debian/Ubuntu
```

3. Install Project Dependencies: Run the npm install command to install the project's dependencies, including the bundled Node.js and npm version. 

```
./bin/npm install
```

4. Run the Build Script: Compile the project's CoffeeScript code by executing the build script. 

```
./bin/npm run build
```

5. After these steps, the Atom repository will be built on your local machine. You can then run the application or run the tests to ensure the build was successful.
